# pharo-ai Lapack experiment

## Requirements

You need to have installed `python3`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas` and `Pharo11` in your computer.

## Generating the datasets

To generate the datasets, you need to run the file DatasetGenerator.py using `python3`.
That will generate the three datasets (small, medium and large) into the `data` directory.
Note that the datasets are generated using a random seed. So you always have exactly the same datasets.
